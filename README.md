# Dear Younger Me
Dear Younger Me is an interactive window installation designed and built by Nick Wallace, Sam Chasan, and Tong Wu. The piece invites people to share their joy, their love, their advice, their regrets, and their heartbreak with their younger selves via text message. Each message is printed out onto a continuous feed of paper, slowly filling the window and allowing passersby to read messages others have sent to themselves.
